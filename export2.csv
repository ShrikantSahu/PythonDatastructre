"g us to offer practical insights into key issues of concern to clients, auditors and regulators.&nbsp;
"
"ASC 805 and IFRS 3 are standards with a high degree of convergence, although certain differences between the two remain. Under bot
"
"h ASC 805 and IFRS 3, the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, with limited exceptions.&nbsp; The identifiable finite-lived assets are then depreciated/amor
"
"tized over their remaining useful lives.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps can help you address complex valuation issues arising in the context of ASC 805 and IFRS 3 throughout the transaction continuum, including:
"
"

"
"    Valuation or structuring of contingent consideration with our team of

"
"    Valuation of options to buy/sell equity interests.

"
"    Allocation of purchase price and goodwill to reporting units (cash generating units).
"
"    Legal entity valuations for tax purpos
"
"es in connection with the business combination.
"
"
"
"Business valuation is impacted by a multitude of factors such as the subject company&rsquo;s industry, its stage of development and the source of the invested capital. Additionally, the variety of purposes for which business valuations a
"
"re performed, the influence of local jurisdictional rules and available valuation methods further increase the complexity of business valuation. It is this complexity that has driven Duff &amp; Phelps to assemble a world class team of profe
"
"ssionals which is unmatched in its collective industry expertise, breadth of service lines and global presence. At the core of this team is a fundamental understanding of business valuation in general, while each team member contributes dee
"
"p industry, service or geographic expertise.
"
"Understanding Value Creation
"
"Business valuation requires a solid grasp of both how value has
"
" been created prior to the valuation date, and how it will continue to be created in the future. The foundation of business valuation is the ability to understand how a company cultivates ideas or concepts and deploys its invested capital,
"
"aiming to drive returns in excess of its cost of capital. The process of value creation does not follow a single path, but rather many paths that vary by industry and t
"
"he company&rsquo;s position in its life cycle. Understanding this process is at the heart of our extensive valuation experience, whether we are performing a valuation analysis for financial reporting, tax, M&amp;A, strategic planning, business restructuring, or dispute and litigation pur
"
"poses.
"
"Measuring Value
"
"Many have described business valuation as both an art and a science. The scientific and analytical aspect employs a variety of approaches or methods applied not only to the subject of th
"
"e valuation itself, but also to the development of certain inputs into the measurement (e.g. cost of capital, discounts and premiums). The most commonly used valuation methods include the cost, market or income (DCF) approaches.&nbsp; While
"
" the cost approach may be applied on occasion, the income and market approaches are by far the most commonly utilized in business valuation. The income approach measures value based upon the present value of future cash flows of the busines
"
"s enterprise, while the market approach relies upon the application of market multiples of comparable companies or comparable transactions to the subject company.
"
"The art of a valuation lies in the ability to apply these tools in an
"
"effective manner, utilizing professional judgment. This type of insight is gained over years of experience across the spectrum of company life cycles, industries, jurisdictions, and valuation purposes, and also calls for a deep understandin
"
"g of regulators&rsquo; and other stakeholders&rsquo; requirements and expectations.
"
"How We Can Help
"
"We tailor the scope of our business valuations to our client&rsquo;s specific needs and the purpose of the en
"
"gagement. When appropriate, our valuation report provides an overview of the company, industry, economy; discusses value drivers; outlines the analysis performed, along with the inputs and assumptions; and incorporates detailed exhibits tha
"
"t support our valuation conclusion. The valuation analysis is sound and the report is defensible, and if challenged, we provide our clients with additional support, including serving as an expert witness at trial.

"Duff &amp; Phelps' Real Estate Advisory Group offers specialized expertise to meet companies' cost segregation needs. We examine properties, identify qualified personal property costs and classify those costs into the appropriate MACRS r

"ecovery period. The firm's cost segregation services yields benefits such as reduced individual and corporate taxes or reduced property tax. Types of real property that should be considered for a cost segregation study include hotels, resor
"
"ts, shopping centers, supermarkets, manufacturing facilities, golf courses, office buildings, warehouses, biotech and pharmaceutical facilities and many other types of buildings.
"
"By understanding the subtleties and intricacies of the
"
" procedures, we can help uncover deductions where companies may not have known they existed.
"
"
"
"Cost segregation studies are typically implemented in cases involving the construction of a new facility, acquisition of existing real
"
" estate or renovation, enhancement or leasehold improvement of an existing facility.
"
"&nbsp;
"
"In addition to newly constructed or acquired facilities, instances of existing properties to which a cost segregation study was never ap

"Unclaimed property is one of the highest sources of revenue in Delaware. Most companies are incorporated in the state of Delaware, as the rules of unclaimed property are most favorable to this state. Delaware actively enforces collection
"
" via its voluntary disclosure agreement (VDA) and audit programs.
"
"
"
"Senate Bill 13, signed into law on February 2, 2017, requires the office of the Delaware Secretary of State to send notifications to all Delaware incorporated en
"
"tities it believes are not in compliance, inviting them to enter the Delaware voluntary disclosure program. Click here for an overview of Delaware&rsquo;s VDA
"
" program.
"
"
"
"Corporations who receive such notification must enroll in the program within 60 days. Those companies that fail to do so are referred to the office of the Delaware Secretary of Finance, which must commence an audit.
"
"
"
"Both programs require an intense examination following predetermined procedures and de
"
"adlines. You can access the steps to enroll in the VDA program here.
"
"
"
"Failure to comply precisely with the VDA or audit program may e

"xpose corporations to significant fines, interest and penalties, as well as material financial statement and reputational implications.

"
"Public and private sector clients have different fixed asset inventory and reporting challenges. However, both rely on accurate information to account for, control and manage their real and personal property assets. Starting with proven
"
"methodology and procedures, our specialists draw upon deep experience and leading-edge technology to constantly evolve and refine new and better procedures.
"
"Historically, executives have viewed fixed assets as having appropriate internal controls and low risk from a financial perspective. Now, in the post-SOX era and with broader IFRS adoption, fixed assets &ndash; often, the biggest line it
"
"em on the balance sheet - are under greater scrutiny. Inferior records - containing ghost assets, grouped assets, vague descriptions, and other data gaps - expose a business to risk in financial, tax, and regulatory compliance.&nbsp;
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps' vast experience and best-practices approach ensure that our clients receive a cleansed and fortified fixed asset register, providing the data visibility required for effective fixed asset management. Additional benefits
"
"to our clients include improved financial reporting, accurate property tax values, streamlined insurable values, meaningful capital budgeting, and support for mergers and acquisitions.
"
"Our dedicated professionals serve organizations
"
"in virtually every industry from offices throughout the world. Each year, we provide fixed asset inventory and reconciliation services to hundreds of clients including manufacturers, telecommunications leaders, healthcare systems, universit

"
"It is critically important to optimally manage tangible equipment assets within an organization. Once the initiative is taken to implement an asset management solution and a process is engineered, the next logical step is to create a com
"
"prehensive awareness of what you possess and utilize by taking inventory.&nbsp;
"
"Our dedicated team provides extensive project planning using Project Management Professional (PMP&reg;) certified methodologies, customized data collecti
"
"on technology, and quality control procedures. We deliver baseline asset inventory projects in a concise timeframe with minimal disruption to your operations environment. These services support clients&rsquo; ITAM and EAM objectives to stre

"
"Our professionals operate from
"
"offices all over the world. Each year, we provide baseline asset inventory services for organizations in virtually every industry, but with extensive breadth and depth for manufacturers, healthcare systems, technology companies and retail o

"
"Inaccurate fixed asset records can cause serious problems for an organization, leading to imprecise financial accounting ledgers and unreliable values for insurance placement. We prepare:
"
"
"
"    Updated fixed asset accounting l
"
"edgers, which include current-year and accumulated depreciation calculations, current-year additions and disposals, and roll forward analyses by account
"
"    Replacement cost valuations for insurance placement and risk management
"
"
"
"Our professionals visit businesses to compile current-year fixed asset activity data by account. We then prepare an updated property record. Alternately, clients supply current-year capital asset activity (additions, disposals,
"
"and retirements), which we use to prepare the updated property record. In addition, we perform annual trend analyses to update replacement cost data based on an appropriate cost trend factor.&nbsp;
"
"Each year, our professionals provid

"e property record outsourcing services for hundreds of public- and private-sector clients. Our proprietary e-PRAIS&reg; system&rsquo;s policies, procedures, and operating effectiveness are in accordance with SOC 1.

"Insureds, brokers, and underwriters rely on accurate property data for risk management purposes. Inflated insurable property values can result in payment of excessive insurance premiums, while inadequate insurance coverage can be disastr

"Inflated insurable property values can cause a business to pay excessive insurance premiums, while having inadequate insurance can be disastrous if a loss occurs. Accurate insurable property values facilitate appropriate allocation of in
"
"surance premiums and can serve as a basis if proof-of-loss documentation is required.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps provides insurance valuation services to clients in virtually all private and public sectors around the world. We inspect and app
"
"raise more than 30,000 buildings annually. Our structured property insurance appraisal programs enable our clients to:
"
"
"
"    Determine the adequacy of property insurance coverage
"
"    Improve risk management practices&nbs
"
"p;
"
"    Improve marketability to underwriters
"
"    Develop a basis for the equitable allocation of premiums
"
"    Avoid surprises at the time of loss
"
"    &nbsp;
"
"    
"
"
"
"Our full-scope property insura
"
"nce appraisal provides the most comprehensive data and involves on-site inspection of each building, capture of building measurements and primary and secondary COPE data, and more. We then prepare detailed statements of insurable values and
"
" building inspection and appraisal reports. In addition, eRISK, our secure web-based reporting system, allows clients to access, manage, and share their insurable values data wherever internet access is provided.
"
"Today&rsquo;s risk managers consider many factors when updating insurable values for equipment and personal property, including:
"
"
"
"    Acquisition or divestiture of facilities and associated equipment
"
"    Rationalizat
"
"ions, transfer of production lines, changes in occupancies, plant additions, etc.
"
"    Turnover of capital assets, especially retirements
"
"    Average asset lives in high-tech and healthcare environments
"
"    Use of
"
"correct cost trend factors to adjust personal property values
"
"
"
"Cost trends are indicators of average change, however - and there is no &ldquo;average&rdquo; assemblage of equipment. Trends vary from industry to industry and sho
"
"uld not be used beyond seven to ten years; thus, re-establishing personal property insurance replacement costs on a five- to seven-year cycle serves as the basis of good underwriting practice.
"
"
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps employs a global team
"
" of experienced equipment valuation specialists. Our professionals use various approaches for personal property insurance appraisals depending on the occupancy and needs of our clients, including detailed asset listing, full physical invent
"
"ory and appraisal, and on-site verification of specific assets.
"
"Currently, it is estimated that 80% of U.S. cities, towns, schools, counties and special districts address some or all of their risk management and risk financing needs through member-owned, member-governed nonprofit risk pools. Property
"
" valuation can be a challenge for risk pools, primarily due to the amount of insured property involved. Many of our risk pool clients have portfolios containing between 5,000 and 10,000 buildings located throughout geographic regions, with
"
"corresponding differences in risks and insured values.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps serves our risk pool clients by:
"
"
"
"    Ensuring uniform reporting of property values to facilitate an equitable allocation of related premiums
"
"   Confirming the completeness of member-submitted property schedules

"Duff &amp; Phelps has been a pioneer in providing appraisal services to risk pools since the early 1990s and the inception of governmental risk poo

"
"
"
"&nbsp;
"
"Once an organization invests in a structured property insurance appraisal program, annual updates offer a cost-effective way to maintain the integrity of insurable value data. Our professionals apply standard construction cost trend fact
"
"ors to appraised building valuations on an annual basis, which:
"
"
"
"    
"
"    Assume static construction practices
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Do not consider modifications to the original structure
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Remain accurate for approximately five to seven years
"
"    
"
"
"
"

"In addition, we update appraised personal property values using industry-accepted cost trend sources, including:

"Post-M&amp;A disputes often involve complex accounting concerns:  properly evaluating transferred working capital, looking into whether earnout thresholds have been achieved, reviewing claimed breaches of financial statement representati
"
"ons and warranties, and at times, investigating allegations of fraud. When post-closing problems do occur, it is essential to engage business-savvy advisers with a thorough understanding of these issues as it can make a meaningful differenc
"
"e in the outcome of the dispute and most importantly, a party&rsquo;s bottom line.
"
"We are a leading provider of expert accounting and valuation consulting, neutral arbitration, and testifying
"
"services to companies facing post-closing
"
" purchase price disputes.  We help corporates, venture capital firms, and

"formal arbitration hearings and in-court litigation.

"
"need to spend the time learning the basics &ndash; we know how to quickly value targets and determine their fair value.

"Throughout the world, competition authorities such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and the European Commission accept remedies offered by merging firms, such as a divestiture, to resolve competition concerns ar

"
"In this situation, the competition authority may require the appointment of a monitoring trustee (also known as merger trustee or interim monitor) to oversee the implementation of the remedies and report to t

"
"As a global financial advisor solving complex financial and business problems on a daily basis, Duff &amp; Phelps is well situated to assist in the complex area of securities litigation. Securities litigation covers a broad area of matte
"
"rs, and Duff &amp; Phelps regularly provides both plaintiff and defense consulting and expert services across these ranges of matters.&nbsp; Our deep industry expertise, government and regulatory experience, and technical leadership is freq
"
"uently on display in high stakes, highly-publicized matters.
"
"Our experts and teams often assist counsel in the following areas of securities litigation:
"
"
"
"
"
"
"
"    Securities class action
"
"    Shareholder deriv
"
"ative litigation (see also shareholder disputes)
"
"    Internal investigations (see also

"
"
"
"Solvency-related issues arise in a variety of disputes surrounding a debtor&rsquo;s bankruptcy. Pre-petition transactions may be subject to clawback-related (e.g., fraudulent transfer) litigation, which often depends on whether the debto
"
"r was insolvent at the time. A debtor&rsquo;s board of directors may be sued for breach of fiduciary duty due to decisions that were made when the debtor was allegedly insolvent.
"
"Solvency-related disputes also arise in other situatio
"
"ns. Worthless stock deductions are challenged by the IRS when it believes the relevant entity was solvent at the time the worthless stock deduction was taken. Otherwise valuable causes of action may not be viable, or are much less lucrative
"
", when the obligor does not have the wherewithal to (fully) pay. These are just some instances where Duff &amp; Phelps experts can provide support.
"
"Professionals within our Disputes Consulting practice have worked as either consultan
"
"ts or testifiers across a variety of industries. Solvency-related assessments have included situations ranging from little and no alleged fraud to allegations of wide-ranging fraud. Our team is frequently called upon to provide solvency-rel
"
"ated thought leadership via publications and presentations at national conferences. We supplement our engagement team with subject matter experts from within the firm (e.g., valuation expert within a certain industry) or through our partner
"
"ship with external specialists (e.g., academic or industry) as needed.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps has deep experience assisting companies and government agencies in state, federal and international tax and regulatory litigation and investigations. We frequently provide expert testimony and reports relating to valuat

"
"
"A solvency opinion makes determinations as to whether, after giving effect to a transaction:
"
"
"
"    The company&rsquo;s assets exceed its debts;
"
"    The company should be able to pay its debts as they come due;
"
"    The company is not left with unreasonably small assets or capital; and
"
"    There is sufficient surplus to effect a distribution.&nbsp;
"
"
"
"These determinations arise from fraudulent transfer statutes and dividend prere

"
"A solvency
"
"analysis and opinion can enhance the company&rsquo;s or board&rsquo;s analysis of any leveraged transaction or contemplated distribution. The types of applicable transactions include:

"
"
"    Spin-offs and split-offs

"
"With tax reform clarified and favorable credit market conditions, private equity sponsors and boards of directors are deliberating leveraged dividend proposals. A dividend that renders a company insolvent, however, has serious consequenc
"
"es for boards of directors. Relying on a third-party solvency opinion creates a &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; (under state laws) for directors that approve dividend payments and stock repurchases. A Duff &amp; Phelps solvency opinion provides a
"
" solid support for decision makers involved in leveraged transactions.
"
"
"
"Solvency Opinion Overview
"
"
"
"A solvency opinion is a collection of determinations as to whether, after giving effect to a transac
"
"tion, (i) the company&rsquo;s assets, at a fair valuation, would exceed its debts, (ii) the company would not be left with unreasonably small assets (or capital), and (iii) the company would be able to pay its debts as they come due. In the
"
" United States, these determinations arise from bankruptcy and fraudulent transfer statutes.
"
"
"
"Solvency opinions also typically address the sufficiency of the company&rsquo;s surplus to pay a distribution, pursuant to corporation
"
", partnership and/or LLC laws in the state of domicile. Company officers may rely on a solvency opinion when providing an officers&rsquo; solvency certificate, which is typically a closing condition of a financing transaction.
"
"
"
"The Duff &amp; Phelps Difference
"
"
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps serves as an independent advisor to boards of directors, special committees and other fiduciaries, and in this capacity, we are a leading global provider of fa
"
"irness and solvency opinions in corporate transactions. Our team has particular expertise in situations where advisor independence is paramount, and scrutiny is elevated.
"
"
"
"    Since 2005, Duff &amp; Ph
"
"elps rendered over 750 solvency opinions aggregating $3.3 trillion in deal value.
"
"    We give each engagement senior level attention; every assignment is overseen by a Managing Director in the Transaction Opinions Group and every o
"

"
"Companies issue debt securities to related parties for numerous reasons. It is critical that such debt is respected as debt by tax authorities. One key factor in assessing if an intercompany debt should be characterized as debt for tax p
"
"urposes is whether or not the terms of the debt are &ldquo;commercially reasonable&rdquo;, defined as being substantially similar to the terms to which an unrelated third party bargaining at arm&rsquo;s length would reasonably be expected t
"
"o agree.
"
"
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps&rsquo; advice can cover the amount of the proposed leverage in the capital structure, the interest rate on the debt, and the other economic terms of the debt security. In addition, Duff &amp; Phelps is oft
"
"en requested to provide a financial opinion regarding the commercial reasonableness of the economic terms of the debt and the leverage in the company&rsquo;s capital structure.
"
"
"
"The following are typical transactions for which Duff &
"
"amp; Phelps has been engaged to provide advice and opinions with respect to intercompany debt:
"
"
"
"
"
"    Multi-national companies utilizing intercompany debt in cross-border acquisitions or in recapitalization or restructuring trans
"
"actions
"
"    
"
"    Current equity holders of a company providing additional capital in the form of debt
"
"    
"
"    Canadian Income Fund offerings and other similar transactions
"
"
"
"For nearly 15 years, company manage
"
"ment, boards of directors, trustees of income funds as well as tax attorneys and tax advisors have relied on Duff &amp; Phelps&rsquo; advice and opinions to support their view that an intercompany debt security should be characterized as de
"
"bt for tax purposes.

"
"The global financial services industry is subject to increasing scrutiny and oversight, with the cost of making mistakes becoming higher both financially and with respect to reputation. New regulatory initiatives are impacting firms on a
"
" local and international level, requiring firms to be cognizant of all legislation and initiatives that affects them. By keeping on top of these regulations, firms retain their competitive advantage in an ever-changing landscape.

"
"Regulatory and compliance programs for financial services firms should be complete, effective and designed to withstand the most stringent regulatory reviews &ndash; without disrupting the business. The best regulatory and compliance pro
"
"grams seamlessly integrate into the firm&rsquo;s business operations.&nbsp; This enables firms to save costs and prevent reputational damage resulting from regulatory enforcement or criminal and civil penalties.
"
"In the U.S., a strong
"
" compliance program is particularly significant as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues its intensive investigative and enforcement efforts. Meanwhile, regulation of the U.S. investment advisory industry continues to
"
"expand, with new efforts across U.S. regulators, including the National Futures Association (NFA) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). In the U.S., compliance programs are also expanding their focus on areas such as cybe
"
"r security and AML measures.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps works with a broad range of firms throughout the business lifecycle, including U.S. and global investment advisers, hedge funds, private equity funds, broker-dealers, BDCs, venture capit
"
"al funds, wealth managers, mutual funds and other alternative and traditional asset managers.
"
"Our team has first-hand practical knowledge and experience, gleaned from years of providing practical start-up and registration assistance,
"
" developing effective compliance and regulatory programs, and assisting with regulatory examinations and investigations. Our dedicated U.S. Compliance Consulting team has in-depth knowledge of the SEC registration process, rules and regulat

"
"Many companies, including asset managers and investors, are continuously searching to identify new ways to enhance performance, find a competitive advantage and minimize portfolio risk. To facilitate these efforts, many companies are loo

"king outside of their traditional financial and economic information sources to alternative data providers to identify other methods of gathering data.
"
"As companies more heavily rely on alternative data, ensuring that data providers
"
"have sufficient oversight and controls, including a robust compliance infrastructure, has become paramount. 
"
"Confidentiality and privacy concerns are also top of mind for many companies as information security regulations become incr

"easingly complex. 
"
"Based on our extensive experience in the regulatory compliance industry, particularly through conducting due diligence on both companies and service providers, we have developed a methodical approach t

"U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&ldquo;CFTC&rdquo;) registration and compliance requiremen
"
"ts historically were designed to regulate positions in listed futures and commodity options contracts, but not swaps trading and hedging.
"
"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street
"
"Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&ldquo;Dodd-Frank Act&rdquo;) mandated the inclusion of swaps trading within the scope of regulated commodity trading activities, and a recent CFTC rule amendment implementing the Dodd-Frank Act r
"
"esulted in the repeal of a regulatory exemption widely used by investment advisers to avoid CTFC registration.
"
"As a result, all advisers of clients that trade swaps,
"
" even if solely for hedging, and/or who previously relied on the repealed exemption must now consider whether to register with the CFTC as a Commodity Pool Operator (&ldquo;CPO&rdquo;) or a Commodities Trading Adviser (&ldquo;CTA&rdquo;).
"
"
"
"Investment advisers required to register with the CFTC through the online registration system of the National Futures Association (&ldquo;NFA&rdquo;) will be subject to an enhanced compliance regime under the Commodity Exchange
"
"Act and related CFTC regulations including risk disclosure, financial reporting and recordkeeping obligations. However, advisers may be able to rely on one of the following available exemptions:
"
"
"
"    The Deminimis Rule (CPO)
"
"    The Small Pool Exemption (CPO)
"
"    The Closely Held Pool Exemption (CPO)
"
"    &nbsp;The CTA Exemption (CTA)
"
"
"
"Advisers relying on these exemptions are not required to register with the CFTC but may be required to file electronic notifications with the NFA. Advisers that are required to register will have CFTC reporting obligations with the
"
" implementation of Form CPO-PQR and Form CTA-PR, although CPOs that are dually registered with the SEC and file Form PF may file Form PF with the SEC in lieu of completing Schedules B and/or C of Form CPO-PQR.
"
"What you will need to consider
"
"If you are unable to take advantage of one of the CFTC exemptions, you w
"
"ill need to register with the CFTC by 31 December 2012. This will involve determining which entities need to register as a CPO or a CTA, identifying the &ldquo;principals&rdquo; and &ldquo;associated persons&rdquo; that need to be included
"
"in the application and whether these individuals will be required to pass the Series 3 National Commodity Futures Examination, and preparing and submitting the required registration forms and fingerprints. CFTC-registered advisers are requi
"
"red to complete an Annual NFA Questionnaire and the NFA requires firms to review their operations on at least an annual basis using the NFA&rsquo;s Self-Examination Checklist. As part of its self-regulatory responsibilities, the NFA conduct

"As a result of the US Dodd-Frank Act signed into law in July 2010, a number of asset managers have found th
"
"at they have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), although many are exempt from full registration. The SEC finalized the rules and exemptions from full registration as an investment adviser with the SEC&nbsp;in Jun
"
"e 2011. Foreign Private Advisers are not required to register with or file information to the SEC. In addition, Private Fund Advisers could be exempt from registering with the SEC under the exempt reporting adviser exemption, as could those
"
" managing solely venture capital funds.
"
"Exempt reporting advisers must prepare and file certain sections of Form ADV Part 1A and are eligible for SEC examination. Duff &amp; Phel
"
"ps can assist exempt reporting advisers in the preparation and filing of Form ADV and in determining whether your firm fits within an exemption, as more fully outlined below:
"
"
"
"    
"
"    Firms that manage more than $25 million in assets in under management and have at least one managed account need to register with the SEC or the state(s) in which they are located and/or doing business.
"
"    
"
"
"
"
"
"    
"
"    Firms that manage up to $150 million in private funds only or manage strictly venture capital funds, may be eligible for a registration exemption.
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Firms that manage less than $25 million in assets under management should review local state law to identify any registration requirements.
"
"    
"

"
"Our global compliance team also has an in-depth understanding of regulatory regimes across jurisdictions, including the SEC, FCA and SFC. We have helped firms to build and maintain the compliance

"ility, and objection to processing.
"
"    Data Security: Personal information must be pseudonymized and encrypted.
"
"    Subject Access Requests/Data Portability: Individuals are permitted to

"
"    Privacy by Design: Organizations are requ
"
"ired to design privacy policies, procedures, and systems at the early stages of any product or process development.
"
"    Data Export to Third Countries: Data can be transferred outside of the European Union under a

"AIM is the junior market for smaller and growing companies operated and regulated by the London Stock Excha
"
"nge through its Regulated Investment Exchange status under Part XVII of the UK&rsquo;s Financial Services &amp; Markets Act 2000 (FSMA 2000). AIM therefore falls within the definition of a Prescribed Market under FSMA 2000 and is subject to
"
" the UK market abuse regime.
"
"Under the directives that form the EU&rsquo;s Financial Services Action Plan, AIM is not a Regulated Market but instead falls within the classificati
"
"on of a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) as defined under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 (MiFID). Since its launch in 1995, more than 3,000 companies have joined AIM, raising more than &pound;80 billion of investment
"
" capital to fund their growth, which made AIM the most successful growth market in the world.
"
"AIM regulatory framework is designed so that the London Stock Exchange delegates cer
"
"tain regulatory responsibilities to the pre-approved nominated advisers (Nomads). The Nomads are responsible to the London Stock Exchange for assessing the appropriateness of an applicant for AIM, or an existing AIM company when appointed a
"
"s its Nomad, and for advising and guiding an AIM company on its responsibilities under the AIM Rules for Companies (&ldquo;AIM Rules&rdquo;).
"
"In May 2014, AIM Regulation publishe
"
"d revised AIM Rules and AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers (&ldquo;Nomad Rules&rdquo;). The changes to the AIM Rules were mainly of an administrative and explanatory nature with a limited number of substantive changes. Changes to the Nomad Ru
"
"les were more substantial and focused on eligibility rules on change of control and continuing eligibility of Qualified Executives.
"
"How Duff &amp; Phelps can help:
"
"In light of the AIM regulatory framework, the compliance of a Nomad with the Nomad Rules is fundamental to the proper operation of the AIM market. As such, Nomads are expected to be able to de

"The Central Bank has an increased focus on the prevention of market abuse. Firms are expected to have strong internal systems and controls in place that allow them to detect abusive behavior in the market.&nbsp;
"
"The prevention, de
"
"tection, investigation and prosecution of market abuse remains a regulatory priority for the Central Bank. Senior management will continue to be held responsible for controls surrounding the prevention of firms&rsquo; systems being used to
"
"commit market abuse.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps has an experienced team including staff that have been Head of Market Surveillance at both exchanges and MTFs. Our staff have assisted many firms with their internal controls to deter and detect
"
" abusive behavior. We have also successfully implemented surveillance systems, acting as the interface between the system provider and the business. Firms need to have good practices and training programs in place in order to protect both t
"
"he firm and staff in case of an investigation.
"
"We have systems in place to address and mitigate risks identified by the regulator and will assist firms in ensuring a route to a compliant culture where policies and systems are establi
"
"shed that are well in line with sound industry practice.
"
"
"
"
"
"Transaction Reporting is a highly complex area that many firms struggle to fully understand and successfully implement, as demonstrated over the years by a number of high profile enforcement cases. Transaction Reports are primar
"
"ily used by the Regulator in the detection of Market Abuse and therefore it is important that reports are accurate and complete.
"
"Fines for transaction reporting failures lead to reputational damage and potentially costly reviews in t
"
"he form of s166 Skilled Persons reports. We have also seen many firms and their senior management being required to sign attestation letters issued by the FCA concerning the accuracy and completeness of their transaction reports.

"&nbsp;
"
"On March 7, 2016 the FCA and PRA introduced the Senior Manager and Certification Regime (&ldquo;SM&amp;CR&rdquo;) to deposit taking institutions, changing the way that individuals are regulated in the financial services industry.
"
"The regime was extended to nearly all FCA regulated firms on December 9, 2019. SM&amp;CR is the biggest change in the regulation of individuals in recent history and introduces a new era of accountability, aiming to improve conduct at all l
"
"evels.&nbsp;
"
"The impact of this new accountability regime is now becoming clearer, with the FCA and PRA now embedding individual conduct and accountability considerations throughout their supervisory and enforcement activities, with
"
"more direct questions being asked of individual Senior Managers.
"
"
"
"
"
"SM&amp;CR &ndash; Post Implementation
"
"Following the implementation of SM&amp;CR to solo-regulated firms the Financial Industry as a whole has entered
"
"into a new era of individual accountability. SM&amp;CR requires firms to articulate how they manage themselves in clear, unambiguous terms that both management and the regulators can understand. SM&amp;CR also requires that those accountabl
"
"e take reasonable steps to ensure that they are managing things in an effective way.&nbsp;
"
"The challenges presented by SM&amp;CR are not just regulatory, they impact the wider business practice and so should not be viewed as somethin
"
"g for the compliance to handle in isolation. Nor should the completion of implementation be viewed as the end of the process. Senior Managers are expected to take a pro-active role in checking things are up to date, both in terms of account
"
"abilities and their own management arrangements.
"
"
"
"
"
"Managing transition
"
"During periods of transition, for example where roles change, Senior Managers join and leave the firm, organizational restructuring &ndash; SM&amp
"
";CR arrangements will need specific attention.
"
"Incoming Senior Managers are increasingly asking firms questions around SM&amp;CR accountabilities and mechanisms firms have in place to support them, often ahead of signing a contract.
"
"Robust SM&amp;CR arrangements are therefore becoming a necessity for firms that want to attract the best talent to the most senior roles.
"
"We believe that the first 100 days are of vital importance for a new Senior Manager, taking tim
"
"e to assess all areas for which they are accountable, identifying gaps and starting to take steps to remediate them Firms should have processes in place to support both outgoing and incoming Senior Managers during this transition.&nbsp;
"
"
"
"
"
"
"
"Evidencing Reasonable Steps
"
"Senior Managers may be asked to evidence that they have taken &lsquo;reasonable steps&rsquo; under the new regime to prevent or stop breaches within their area of responsibility. It is impor
"
"tant that each Senior Manager understands what they and other Senior Managers are responsible for within the firm. Each Senior Manager will want to review their area of responsibility and ensure that they are comfortable with the arrangemen
"
"ts and able to evidence that they personally have taken steps to ensure that breaches can be prevented. In order to evidence this review, we believe senior managers should take a four-stage approach:
"
"
"
"Verify
"
"    Confirm responsibilities are accurate and understood, updating them where necessary.
"
"    Diagnose
"
"    Undertake a review of each area of responsibility, the key challenge
"
"s, areas for improvement, key risks, culture, structure and governance arrangements in place.&nbsp;
"
"    Prioritize
"
"    Risk rate and prioritize the findings and set out plans to address them, escalate if nece
"
"ssary and discuss with relevant parties to develop risk-based responses to issues.
"
"    Act
"
"    Implement the necessary changes, focusing on sustainable solutions and evidencing systems and controls.
"
"
"
"Below we have set out some of the key headings that should inform any review:
"
"
"
"Key Areas of Review
"
"
"
"    Governance Arrangements
"
"    Consider whether existing arrangements, and the manag
"
"ement information that supports governance, are up-to-date and remain fit for purpose. While governance arrangements are often designed and managed on a firm wide basis, each Senior Manager should look to ensure that they have appropriate a
"
"rrangements within their area of responsibility, such as formalizing departmental decision making and committees.&nbsp;
"
"    Delegation and Oversight
"
"    Assess whether the appropriate tools and mechanisms are
"
" in place which accountable individuals use to delegate with confidence and maintain effective oversight. This will include reporting lines, escalation, incident and risk reporting mechanisms.
"
"    Policies and Procedures
"
"    Review whether staff have access to clear documentation, that their work can be monitored against agreed standards and that controls and check points have been assessed and documented. Handover frameworks will also need to
"
"be reviewed to ensure that new Senior Managers have the information they need to make their own departmental diagnosis.
"
"    Training and Support
"
"    Consider whether staff have sufficient training and ongoing
"
" support in order to understand the Conduct Rules and how they affect them in their roles and identify potential risks.&nbsp;
"
"    Fit and Proper (&ldquo;FIT&rdquo;) Assessments
"
"    Review whether there are sa
"
"tisfactory processes in place for ensuring that individuals are fit and proper.
"
"    Crisis Response
"
"    Ensure that sufficient mechanisms are in place for investigation and reaction to breaches that may occur
"
" within an area of responsibility to enable accountable staff to react quickly and effectively to emerging problems.&nbsp;
"
"    Change Management
"
"    Assess whether the firm has appropriate systems and control
"
"s in place to effectively manage change within the firm.

"
"
"
"Most functions within a firm are audited and monitored on a frequent basis by the compliance and risk functions. However, the review and assessment of these functions themselves is frequently overlooked, especially if the firm does not h
"
"ave an Internal Audit function or resources allocated to it.
"
"Under the overarching organizational requirements of SYSC 4 and the more specific requirements of SYSC 6 and 7, firms are required to ensure that they have adequate complia
"
"nce and risk functions as demanded by their nature and complexity and the regulated activities that they undertake. There is increasing focus in the marketplace and from investors on operational risk, the role of the control environment and
"
" the compliance function.
"
"For a firm to have confidence in the ability of its compliance and risk functions, it may become necessary to request an independent party to review and comment upon the validity of its operations, and the e
"
"ffectiveness and coverage of the activities of the oversight functions. Those responsible for managing these functions are facing constantly shifting goalposts, and without an independent expert health check, it is possible to fail to meet
"
"requirements or to allow areas to fall behind the curve of expectations. The regulatory environment is turbulent and the requirements placed upon firms frequently shift.&nbsp;
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps' review would be tailored to provide th
"
"e firm with an analysis of the appropriateness of the compliance and risk functions, taking into consideration the nature, complexity and size of the firm as well as assurance that the stated policies and processes are followed through an i
"
"ndependent examination. We would assess key documents and interview key personnel in the functions plus senior management if required. The output can be either formal or informal.
"
"All firms authorized by the FCA are required to submit periodic financial and other returns through GABRIEL and also via other dedicated FCA portals and methods. Firms subject to the Capital Requirements Directive also need to submit COR
"
"EP returns using the XBRL format.

"We provide regulatory consultancy advice to a wide range of firms such as hedge fund managers, retail wealth managers, private equity firms, institutional stock brokers and corporate finance advisers

"The&nbsp;FCA&nbsp;authorization process has taken on a heightened importance in the regulator&rsquo;s arsen

"
"Obtaining &lsquo;Part4A Permission&rsquo; from the FCA to conduct &lsquo;regulated activities&rsq

"The Skilled Persons Report is a component of the tools that the regulator uses to intervene early when a pa

"Duff &amp; Phelps has systems in place to address and mitigate risks identified by th
"
"e regulator and will assist firms to ensure a route to a compliant culture where policies and systems are established that are in line with sound industry practice.
"
"
"
"In the UK, these independent reviews are known as section 166 (of the Financial Services and Markets Act 20
"
"00) or Skilled Person reports.
"
"How Duff &amp; Phelps Can Help
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps has many years of experience acting
"
"as a Skilled Person, not just in the UK, but also more recently in Hong Kong and the Channel Islands.&nbsp;
"
"Our deep bench of regulatory consultants has expertise covering all as
"
"pects of regulation, and is particularly strong in the areas of Client Assets (CASS), suitability, transaction reporting, financial crime, prudential, governance, risk and compliance and systems and controls.
"
"You will receive hands-on, personal attention of senior team members.&nbsp;We transfer our industry insight over time, allowing your organization to plan and react to regulatory change more effectively.
"
"We have an established governance and oversight framework for managing and delivering each review, which is supported by fully documented policies and procedures. We are ISO 9001 accre
"
"dited, which requires us to maintain a broad range of policies, procedures and controls all of which are relevant to undertaking and overseeing assignments.
"
"We establish an open
"
"and regular dialogue with the regulator and the firm, from the initial dialogue regarding the scope of the assignment, through to issuing the report. This approach, in our experience, allows for ongoing feedback between all parties to ensur
"
"e that issues are communicated in a timely manner and dealt with effectively.
"
"On March 20, 2017 Duff &amp; Phelps (formerly Kinetic Partners LLP) was re-appointed to the Skilled
"
"Person Panel.
"
"
"
"&nbsp;
"
"
"
"The FCA requires all firms to recruit staff who have the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise to undertake the role that is allocated to them. In addition, the FCA expects firms to make sure that all employees are aware of the inter
"
"nal procedures of the firm. As part of their systems and controls, firms therefore need to train staff on a regular basis to keep their knowledge up to date. This is in addition to the more detailed Training and Competence rules where firms
"
" conduct business with retail customers.
"
"In addition to this, staff need to be trained in Anti-Money Laundering and Market Abuse and part of the legal or regulatory requirements.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps has an experienced team, work
"
"ing together with firms and compliance officers, to develop bespoke training seminars and packages that are relevant for your business models, and which addresses the risks to which you are exposed. We pitch the training at the appropriate
"
"level, depending on whether there is a mixed audience or distinct levels of experience or seniority.
"
"In addition, tests can be developed for staff, to enable firms to demonstrate the effectiveness of their training. Duff &amp; Phelps
"
" also provides training to prospective compliance personnel to assist in the application to the FCA in respect of their approved status.
"
"We are able to cover a wide range of regulatory topics, including:
"
"
"
"    Financial cr
"
"ime, incorporating market abuse, anti-money laundering, Bribery Act and fraud
"
"    Senior management arrangements, systems and controls, including conflicts, data security, business continuity, apportionment of responsibilities and

"    Reporting under GABRIEL and COREP
"
"
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps&rsquo; experts have assisted Regulated Markets (RIEs), MTFs and OTFs in meeting their regulatory obligations and in remediating issues. This work has covered a wide variety of areas such as market abuse detection and su
"
"rveillance, transparency waivers, algorithmic trading arrangements, conflicts of interest, incentive schemes and transaction reporting.
"
"&nbsp;
"
"We have assisted firms in the process of obtaining trading venue permissions and have
"
" also undertaken s.166 reviews of trading venues on behalf of the FCA.
"
"
"
"The ""close and continuous"" relationship that the FCA wants to have with UK-regulated trading venues opens the operators of those venues to much greater leve
"
"l of scrutiny than they will be used to.
"
"
"
"The prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of market abuse remains an area of significant focus for the FCA and the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&amp;CR) increase
"
"s the likelihood of senior managers being held to account for shortcomings personally.

"For alternative investment firms such as private equity and hedge fund managers, operational risk and/or investment risk can lead to an investor&rsquo;s assets dramatically diminishing in value. Operational due diligence (ODD) considers

"ice providers.

"Managers who ut

"
" benefit from the &ldquo;EU passport&rdquo; and will in each case be treated as third-country AIF managers. Consequently, those UK entities will no longer be able to manage funds and market funds in the EU on a cross-border basis using thei

"HMRC have invested significantly in technology and now require corporate entities to file their annual corporate returns online accompanied by financial statements converted into iXBRL language. This permits HMRC to assess, analyze and c

"ollate a substantial amount of data. HMRC provide a taxonomy which is frequently updated for changes in accounting standards and legislation and they are strict in their requirements of its use.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps has specific softwar
"
"e to ensure that your accounts are accurately tagged using the current taxonomy required by HMRC. Additionally, we apply our accounting expertise and understanding of accounting standards to ensure appropriate compliance with HMRC&rsquo;s r
"
"equirements.
"
"
"
" An offshore fund&rsquo;s activities may give rise to a UK tax liability through the activities of its UK r
"
"epresentatives being its investment manager. The Investment Manager Exemption (IME) provides a tax exemption so that such charges do not arise, subject to the manager meeting certain requirements.
"
"Meeting the IME requirements are therefore essential for an investment manager seeking to protect the tax integrity of the fund. Some of the key tests are:
"
"
"
"    
"
"    Whether there is a trade &ndash; the liability arises in relation to trading funds and not investment funds
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Independent capacity and customa
"
"ry remuneration &ndash; the manager must operate on an arm&rsquo;s length basis from the fund and receive customary remuneration
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    20% test &ndash; the manag
"
"er and persons connected with them must not be entitled to more than 20% of the income in the fund. This test can be difficult for managers to meet&nbsp;in certain circumstances
"
"    
"
"
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps has significant experience in structuring new managers to ensure that IME tests are met. We also assess the structure of already established arrangements, assess compliance and make recommendations for addi
"
"ng robustness to the arrangements. We will liaise with investors, auditors and regulators on our clients&rsquo; behalf in discussing compliance with the IME.
"
"Through our services
"
" you will have better industry insight into the application of the exemption, be assured that the tax integrity of your fund will be protected, and you will know practical solutions to potential problem areas.

"
"The pressure on revenue authorities globally to increase tax receipts and tackle tax avoidance continues to increase year on year. HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) has spent billions of pounds improving their technology capabilities resul
"
"ting in more accurate and easily comparable data being made available to them. Increased reporting requirements to the HMRC, the FCA and international tax and regulatory bodies, and a move towards tax transparency, has highlighted the need
"
"to control the way information is disclosed.
"
"All UK taxpayers should take care with the information they are reporting to ensure it is accurate, sufficient and timely.&nbsp; Being up to date and fully compliant with your tax reportin

"g will minimize the risk of inquiries or penalties.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps can assist investment managers with tax compliance matters. As advisers to the financial services industry, we provide a compliance service beyond simply the compl

"An opportunity to restructure an investment management company will often arise when considering business c
"
"hanges affecting products, people or location. It may also arise as a result of reviewing the current operating model or from changes to tax and regulatory regimes. Typically, the goal is to ensure tax, regulatory and operational efficienci
"
"es for the group and its shareholders.
"
"Such restructuring will need to be robust from a tax perspective, especially given the current interest by tax authorities in the industry.
"
" Likewise, when establishing a new investment management company, there are a number of options to consider and the tax, regulatory and operational issues are paramount.
"
"To ensur
"
"e a reliable and tax efficient structure, Duff &amp; Phelps will manage the project or&nbsp;provide advice on it. This includes tax, regulatory, operational and technology advice. We analyze the need and impact of restructuring for business

"
"
"Since their introduction in 2000, limited liability partnerships (LLPs) have been an increasingly popular s
"
"tructure through which to operate a UK business due to the flexibility it affords its members. However, the combination of the new partnership taxation rules that came into force from April 2014, and the reduced rate of corporation tax, wil
"
"l tip the balance back in favor of a more traditional corporate structure for some businesses.
"
"The changes in the UK partnership tax rules will have a particular impact on LLPs w
"
"hose partners are reclassified as salaried members, or those LLPs which will be restricted as a result of the mixed membership rules. There is no &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; answer and much depends on where the business sits in its life
"
" cycle and the plans for the future.
"
"How Duff &amp; Phelps Can Help
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps has a large team of profession
"
"als that can draw upon their tax, accounting and regulatory experience in helping businesses decide whether an LLP or a Ltd company structure best suits their needs. We can help clients make informed decisions through modelling financial pe
"
"rformance using scenario analysis and practical experience of implementing remuneration structures that maximize returns for stakeholders. Our services extend from assisting start-up businesses to design their optimum structure, to restruct
"
"uring long-established businesses from an LLP to a Ltd, or vice versa.
"
"Our offering can be tailored for the specific needs and objectives of each client to create bespoke solutio
"
"ns; specifically, these can include:
"
"
"
"    
"
"    Project managing implementation through the sometimes opposing commercial, tax and accounting challenges whilst liaising di
"
"rectly with regulators to deliver on desired timescales;
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Modelling effective tax rates and designing suitable remuneration strategies that comply with incr
"
"easingly complex tax and regulatory regimes;
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Advising on the recognition and valuation of any goodwill that may crystalize on restructuring, and the tax tr
"
"eatment thereon;
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Evaluation and claiming of specific tax reliefs including rollover, gift, entrepreneurs&rsquo;, VAT TOGC, EIS, SEIS and business investmen
"
"t relief.
"
"    
"
"
"
"
"
"Given the discrepancy between capital gains and income tax rates, seeking Rep
"
"orting fund status (RFS) for your fund will make it more attractive for UK investors to invest into and more readily marketable. RFS can also be advantageous for management share classes when co-investing into funds you manage. While obtain
"
"ing RFS can ease distribution of offshore funds to UK investors, it is not suitable for every offshore fund. The implications of obtaining RFS and the method chosen when undertaking the annual reporting obligations should be carefully consi
"
"dered.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps can navigate you through the offshore funds legislation interpreting what it means for your offshore fund and the on
"
"going obligations you and your investors will be under once you enter the regime. Once we have determined that RFS is advantageous for your fund we will make the application to HMRC on your behalf ensuring the chosen elections are made with
"
"in the respective timescales.
"
"RFS requires annual reporting be made to HMRC of ongoing compliance and to investors of the arising reportable
"
"income. We can perform:
"
"
"
"    the calculations of reportable income liaising directly with the administrator of your fund
"
" assist with the communication to investors; and
"
"    compile the annual submission to HMRC.

"
"
"The financial crisis and increased regulatory scrutiny underscore the need for financial services firms to better understand, monitor and disclose their risks, in particular when investing in more complex products and strategies. As a re
"
"sult, regulators are now increasingly concerned about risk monitoring and transparency and more risk and compliance monitoring will be imposed on the investment community going forward. UCITS IV new risk guidelines and requirements clearly
"
"illustrate this trend.
"
"Investment managers, service providers and investors need to extend the scope and depth of their risk reporting and monitoring to better understand their overall risk as well as fulfill their regulatory reporti
"
"ng obligations.

"The global financial crisis was the catalyst for an era of sweeping regulatory change across the financial services industry. Financial institutions now face stringent requirements in relation areas such as risk management frameworks and
"
" risk culture, capital adequacy, liquidity adequacy, stress tests and resolution plans. The ability of the board of directors and senior management to demonstrate the firm&rsquo;s resilience through sound risk management and capital plannin
"
"g practices remains a key priority for the regulator.
"
"
"
"How Duff &amp; Phelps Can Help
"
"Our Enterprise and Capital Risk Management practice assists U.S. firms with a broad range of regulatory requirements,
"
"including:
"
"
"
"    Risk management frameworks: assisting with or reviewing the firm&rsquo;s arrangements in relation to the identification, quantification, reporting and management of all types of risk, including a
"
"dvising on risk governance matters.
"
"    Capital planning: reviewing and advising on the firm&rsquo;s capital plan under CCAR requirements.
"
"    Model risk management: model validation for v
"
"arious valuation and risk management processes linked to financial reporting and CCAR processes.
"
"    CCAR and DFAST: analytical and advisory services related to CCAR and DFAST reporting including in relation to rec
"
"overy and resolution planning, strategy and living will submissions.
"
"    Regulatory reporting: assisting with the preparation of regulatory reporting forms such as FR Y-14A/Q/M as well as assisting with CCAR CFO at
"
"testations.
"
"
"
"Our Services
"
"
"
"    Health check: Undertaking a high level gap analysis of your current capital and enterprise risk management arrangements against regulatory expectation
"
"s and industry best practice.
"
"    Review and recommend: Undertaking independent bespoke reviews of your current arrangements against regulatory expectations and industry best practice to identify opportunities for
"
"improvements to processes, procedures and controls.
"
"    Assurance: Providing assurance on the effectiveness of the design and operation of capital planning and risk related controls.
"
"    Change man
"
"agement: Designing, managing and implementing change programs.
"
"    Remediation: Developing and assisting with the implementation of remediation plans to address supervisory concerns.
"
"    P
"
"olicies and framework: Reviewing or documenting policies, procedures and controls.
"
"    Training: Providing tailored training and workshops to key staff.
"
"    Compliance monitoring and inter
"
"nal audit: Designing, implementing and / or reviewing internal monitoring arrangements in relation to capital and enterprise risk management.
"
"
"
"
"
"The key elements to a sound investment and regulatory limits monitoring framework cover:
"
"
"
"    
"
"    The ability to clearly define the investment policy, authorized instruments and any limitations or restrictions listed in the prospectus/offering memorandum as well as the releva
"
"nt regulatory constraints.
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    The ability to monitor these restrictions and limits accordingly, which involves defining how to measure the various exposures a
"
"nd comparing them to investment limits and regulatory restrictions.
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Defining the actions to be taken should any breach in compliance be detected (escalatio
"
"n procedure, remedial, best approach to protect the investors).
"
"    
"
"
"
"Recent regulatory changes &ndash; such as the latest UCITS IV guidelines &ndash; have clearly emph
"
"asized the need for more robust, precisely documented and carefully monitored risk management and compliance monitoring frameworks.
"
"&nbsp;
"
"
"
"
"
"Quality and appropriate risk monitoring is a key element of the risk management process. Managers are expected to define their risk appetite and how it translates into exposures, leverage, concentration, market, counterparty and liquidit
"
"y risk limits. Risk modelling and reporting require complex tools and sophisticated methodologies, even for relatively simple instruments and strategies.
"
"It is critical to model and monitor risk both in normal and abnormal market con
"
"ditions, in particular through:
"
"
"
"    
"
"    Exposures and Sensitivities (equity, rates, FX, credit, spread, inflation, etc.)
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Global exposure/value at risk and related measures such as Risk Contribu
"
"tion of individuals&rsquo; positions, subset of portfolio, top contributors, etc.
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Historical stress and scenarios analysis
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Credit Risk and counterparty concentration
"
"    
"
"    
"
"    Liquidity profile and alignment
"
"    
"
"
"
"Risk monitoring is an exercise that requires sophisticated modelling and often the use of a third-party solution. It is very important to be able to choose the right sol
"
"ution, which requires understanding the requirements for a risk system, assessing the methodology used and whether it is adequate to the type of instruments and strategy involved as well as performing ongoing model testing.
"
"Building an appropriate risk management process and maintaining it over time is a complex task and can require a dedicated risk team, especially in the context of
"
"the increased requirements and responsibilities imposed by the regulators.
"
"Considering the complexity and the evolving requirements to establish a quality risk management process, it may be extremely beneficial to appoint external ri
"
"sk experts to:
"
"
"
"    Review your organization&rsquo;s risk management process
"
"    Establish the necessary governance at corporate or fund levels
"
"    Assist in defining risk limits
"
"    Review and validat
"
"e risk/pricing models as per regulatory requirements
"
"    Identify and assist with any necessary disclosure as required by regulators
"
"    Recommend and assist in the implementation of senior management systems and controls
"
"    Assist with selection and specification of risk system platforms
"
"    Provide risk training to key staff and senior management including funds&rsquo; board of directors
"
"
"
"More and more firms are moving to co-sourcing as a way to reduce operational risk, manage business expansion and deal with change issues, be they implementing new systems or revising current work practices. Equally, the nature of day to
"
"day business means firms must often cope with staff issues on short notice, such as resignation, ill-health, disciplinary issues or employee leave.
"
"We can provide highly qualified team members globally and at various levels on a full-
"
"time or part-time basis, including permanent placement, secondment or co-sourcing arrangement. Examples of our staffing support services include:&nbsp;
"
"
"
"    Acting as Chief Compliance Officer for large UK and U.S. fund managers;
"
"
"
"    Providing interim compliance support between the departure of an employee and the commencement of a new one;
"
"    On-going regular on-site support for routine compliance matters;
"
"    Identification and placeme
"
"nt of front and back office personnel, including attorneys and compliance professionals;
"
"    Project management and regulatory support for the MiFID authorization of a new clearing company;
"
"    Acting as Head of Compliance
"
" for a UK Clearing Bank with EMEA remit;
"
"    Acting as interim head of depository for a global custodian; and
"
"    Acting as MLRO for a fund administrator.
"
"
"
"Our team members come from a range of backgrounds inc
"
"luding asset management, legal, regulatory compliance, administration, trustee/custodian services and stockbroking.
"
"
"
"Investment managers operating under UCITS or AIFMD have to deal with increased regulatory requirements. Nav
"
"igating these has proven to be costly and resource-intensive, and reduce investment managers&rsquo; time to focus on managing assets and raising capital. Creating the necessary substance for instance typically requires a sufficient critical
"
" size, estimated at &euro;5bn, in order to run a viable and perennial internal model. An alternative solution is delegating the regulatory compliance obligations to a recognized outsourced entity.
"
"Duff &amp; Phelps&rsquo; third party management company (or Super ManCo) provides the necessary substance, infrastructure, staff, systems, reporting disclosure and supervision of delegated activities pertaining to the AIF
"
"M/UCITS ManCo duties. This is applicable for all asset classes in the alternative investment space, including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, infrastructure and debt funds.
"
"We are also responsible for the investment management function of your business, concentrating on the risk management function, whilst at the same time sub-delegating portfolio management. We seamlessly plug ourselves into your environ
"
"ment, thereby allowing you to focus on your core priorities while providing you with peace of mind that your regulatory requirements are adhered to in a cost-effective and pragmatic way.
"
"Our unique combination of expertise in distribution matters is an additional benefit of our services,&nbsp;helping&nbsp;you to address distribution challenges, market intelligence and registration/notification/maintenance tasks, vi
"
"a a consistent and integrated approach.&nbsp;When appointed as your third-party management company, an experienced team of three Conducting Officers will be assigned to you, on top of which our distribution subject-matter experts are system
"
"atically involved.
